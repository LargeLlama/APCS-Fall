Response to
Episode 1 - "Standing Up in the Milky Way"
@-------------------------------------------------
 - Seeing Obama was surprising, I didn't know he was involved in the production of this!

 - I remember going to the Museum of Natural History as a kid and I would always see the same exhibit every time, which was some cool demonstration about space. I've liked    the topic ever since I was a wee lil boy, and this episode gave me a nostalogic feeling :)

 - I also did not know there was an original series and this is sort of a reboot! (gosh im young)

 - I studied Galileo a great deal in AP Euro last year, so I'm well acquainted with the struggle between science and church, and though I believe in God I still respect and   am fascinated by science.
  
 - The Cosmic Calendar was really cool and I really liked the analogy he made with a regular, Gregorian calendar and how all of human history would be in the last minute of   the last day - makes me feel insignificant and significant at the same time. We are but specks in the universe, but this thought doesn't sadden me. It just makes me feel   extra happy that I'm one of the specks that happen to exist at this very time. 

10/10 would watch again

Response to
Episode 3 - "When Knowledge Conquered Fear"
@-------------------------------------------------

 - The whole usage of astronomy and stuff reminds me of how massive structures, like the Great Pyramid, and Stonehenge, line up with certain cosmic events. Makes sense - as   primitive humans only way to measure time and stuff was via the sky, and even today it's based off the sun and stuff, just in a form that's easier for us to see (clocks    and stuff)

 - Oort is a funny name lol

 - Comets are cool, I learned in AP English that Samuel Clements (aka Mark Twain) was born and died on the passing of Halley's comet

 - I can fully blame Newton for having to take physics and why I did so badly on some of my tests. He should've made his conclusions easier to understand or something...

 - The shift from mythology and how the civilizations before us viewed the heavens as something that could never be understood to something that is concrete and can be        studied.
 
 - THe merging of Andromeda and Milky Way was something I read about when I was younger, and seeing the animation was wicked gnarly.
